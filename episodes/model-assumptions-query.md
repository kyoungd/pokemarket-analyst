Goal: I am building a probabilistic financial model to forecast future pricing. Before I look for a model, I want to make sure that we research our basic assumptions that goes into building that model. I am always looking for the most probabilistic outcome. I need you to discover what model criteria are influential, apply them according to their influence.
Please conduct deep research to quantify the following categories of model inputs. If you find other categories, feel free to add:
1. The "Structural Shift" (Supply & Hoarding Risks)
Test the "Junk Wax" Thesis: That the market has fundamentally changed from a scarcity model to a saturation model.
Supply Shock Quantification: Verify the print run delta. Specifically, confirm the jump from ~1-2 billion cards/year (pre-2019) to ~9-10+ billion cards/year (2022-2024).
The "Hoarding Coefficient" (Attrition Rate):
Vintage Assumption: What estimated % of 1999 Base Set supply survived in collectible condition? (Likely <1%).
Modern Assumption: Find estimates for the "Shadow Inventory" of modern sealed product (e.g., Evolving Skies, 151). Is it estimated that 20-30% of supply is currently held sealed by investors?
Model Input: Does this high retention rate create a "Price Ceiling" where latent supply unlocks every time prices rise?
Demand Curve Transition: Look for economic analysis on collectibles transitioning from "Exponential" (niche viral growth) to "Linear" (mainstream saturation). Do mature collectibles markets (like Comics or Coins) typically plateau to track GDP/Inflation after a boom cycle?
2. The Macro-Economic Overlay ("K-Curve" Stress Test)
Test the correlation between high-end collectibles and the "wealth effect" of the tech/crypto sectors.
Correlation Coefficients: Run a comparison of the "PWCC 100" or similar high-end card indexes against:
The NASDAQ-100: Do high-end cards ($1k+) move in lockstep with tech stocks?
Crypto (BTC/ETH): Is there a quantifiable "lag"? (e.g., Does a Crypto crash predict a card price drop 2-3 months later?)
Interest Rate Sensitivity: How does the "Cost of Capital" (Fed Funds Rate) impact sealed product pricing? When rates are high (5%), do we see increased liquidation of sealed inventory due to opportunity cost?
Disposable Income Elasticity: Differentiate between "Mass Market" (modern packs) and "High End" (vintage slabs). Is the high end more sensitive to "White Collar" tech employment data than general inflation?
3. Technical Dilution (The "Grade Flation" Risk)
Quantify the devaluation of "Mint" condition due to improved manufacturing and preservation.
Gem Mint Ratios: Compare the PSA 10 success rate for a major Vintage set (e.g., Jungle) vs. a major Modern set (e.g., Obsidian Flames).
Population Growth: If Modern cards have a 50-70% PSA 10 rate (vs Vintage 1%), how should the model discount the future "Mint Premium"?
Liquidity & Friction: Define the standard "Exit Cost." What is the total percentage deduction for selling mid-to-high-end cards (Platform fees + Shipping + Insurance + Liquidity Discount)? Is 20% a safe baseline assumption?
4. Baseline Valuation Assumptions
Historical CAGR: What is the 5-year and 10-year Compound Annual Growth Rate for "Vintage" vs. "Modern" indices?
Modern Decay Curve: For a newly released set, what is the standard "Race to the Bottom" timeframe? (e.g., Does the price floor typically hit at Month 6 or Month 12 post-release?)
5. Global Arbitrage & Hard Constraints (New Segment)
The Wholesale Floor: Determine the standard Distributor Wholesale Price for a booster box (e.g., ~$82-$90 USD).
Risk Test: Historically, how long does a modern set stay below this wholesale price on the secondary market before correcting? (This sets the "Max Drawdown" limit for the model).
The "Japanese Signal" (Leading Indicator): Analyze the impact of massive reprints in the Japanese market (specifically the Japanese 151 reprint in 2024/2025). Did that supply shock cause a permanent price depression or a temporary dip? Use this as a proxy for English reprint risk.
Output Requirements:
I am looking for a well-thought out list of assumptions (or constraints) for a Pokemon TCG Price prediction model.
