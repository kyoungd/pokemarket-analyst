## **PokeMarket Analyst: Episode 1 — "The Cardboard Apocalypse"**

**[SCENE START]**

**[VISUAL: The video has heavy film grain and slightly desaturated colors (drab browns, mustards, and greys). A title card appears in a clunky, white font: "THE POCKET MONSTER PROFITABILITY REVIEW".]**

**[Music: A jaunty, slightly out-of-tune brass band march.]**

**[VISUAL: Cut to the PRESENTER. He is sitting behind a desk that is far too small for him. On the desk is a rotary phone, a stack of manila folders labeled "TOP SECRET," and a single, wilted brown plant. He wears a beige polyester suit and a wide, loud tie.]**

**PRESENTER**
Good evening. Tonight, we look at the curious case of the ‘Pokemon Investor.’ A creature characterized by a twitching eye, a basement full of plastic-wrapped boxes, and a profound, almost religious terror of humidity.

**[VISUAL: Extreme close-up on the Presenter’s face. He stares unblinkingly. One of his eyelids gives a slight, rhythmic twitch.]**

**PRESENTER (Whispering)**
The market is "taking off," they say. It’s "frenzied." Usually, when thousands of grown men start screaming about shiny lizards, we call for a priest. Today, we call it a "Financial Strategy."

**PRESENTER (Reading flatly)**
"Before we proceed, the Legal Department—a group of individuals with even less soul than a silverfish—insists I state the following: I am not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice. I am merely a man in a polyester suit expressing opinions on cardboard. If you bankrupt yourself based on my ramblings, the only thing you’ll be entitled to from me is a look of mild disappointment. Right. That’s done."

**[VISUAL: Cut to a grainy, black-and-white still photo of a Pikachu mascot costume. It is sitting on a wooden stool in a dark room, looking dejected. A small plaque in front of it says "INMATE 702."]**

**PRESENTER (V.O.)**
2026. The 30th Anniversary. The Year of Hype. Every five years, like a recurring bout of malaria, the "Pokemon Frenzy" returns. FOMO—Fear Of Missing Out—is currently driving prices to record highs, usually fueled by people who think "Diversified Portfolio" is a fancy way of saying "I have more than one Bulbasaur."

**[VISUAL: Back to the desk. The Presenter is now wearing thick rubber gloves. He uses long, medical-grade silver tongs to lift a Pokemon 151 Elite Trainer Box from a metal tray, holding it away from his body as if it might explode.]**

**PRESENTER**
If you’re buying now, congratulations. You are what we in the industry call "The Exit Liquidity." Or, in layman's terms: "The Poor Sods Holding the Bag While the Smart Money Retires to a beach resort."  OK.  Here comes the numbers.  Try to stay awake.  Let's look at the 151 Elite Trainer Box, one of the most beloved set of Scarlet & Violet era.  It is money in the bank, right?  This is the projection of this set each year from 2026 to 2031, and it lists the expected highest value of that year.

**[VISUAL: A graphic appears. It looks like it was drawn with a felt-tip pen on a stained napkin. The "Chart of Inevitable Disappointment" shows a line that goes up briefly, then crashes into a drawing of a skull.]**

* **2026 (The Anniversary Spike):** $240. You feel like a king. You buy a silk bathrobe.
* **2027 (The Regret Year):** $215. The bathrobe is now itchy.
* **2028 (The Great Recession):** $190. You consider eating the cards for sustenance.
* **2030 (Supply Attrition):** $255. A slight recovery as several thousand boxes are lost to a flooded basement in Slough.
* **2031 (The 35th Anniversary):** $340.  Finally, an exit.

**[VISUAL: The Presenter uses a wooden yardstick to tap the napkin graphic aggressively.]**

**PRESENTER**
"$340 isn't that bad," you say. Well, after you pay your 20% for shipping, seller fees, and the emotional toll of dealing with a buyer named "PikaHunter69," your total revenue is **$272.00.**

**[VISUAL: The screen splits. On the left, a man in a tuxedo is calmly drinking tea (S&P 500). On the right, a cartoon silverfish is chewing a hole through a holographic Pokemon card.]**

**PRESENTER**
That is a "whopping" **2.53% annual return.** If you had simply parked that $240 in an S&P 500 index fund, you’d be looking at a cool 7% return—roughly $336.00. And the best part? The S&P 500 doesn't require climate control, it won't be stolen by your nephew, and most importantly... the silverfish won’t eat your S&P 500.

**[VISUAL: The Presenter stares directly into the lens, frozen. He doesn't move or blink for three full seconds.]**

**PRESENTER**
Oh, I know what you’re shouting at your monitor. "But the *Sun and Moon Team Up* box is worth nine thousand dollars! You’re a fraud, Sir! A charlatan!" Well, sit down. Here comes the reality slap in the face.

**[VISUAL: The studio lights dim. A single, harsh spotlight shines on the Presenter. Fake lightning flashes outside a window behind him.]**

**PRESENTER**
It was an one-time thing, and it won't happen again.  Why?

First: **Greasy Fingers.** **[VISUAL: Close-up of a pair of child’s hands, covered in thick, neon-orange cheese dust, slowly smearing the dust across a shiny Charizard card.]**

**PRESENTER (V.O.)**
In the old days, children — those horrible, sticky, unwashed children—opened Pokemon cards and destroyed them with their greasy little fingers. Scarcity was born from carnage. But today? Today, every grandmother in the country has a pristine 151 collection tucked in the closet.

**[VISUAL: Back to the Presenter. He is now leaning over the desk, his face filling the screen.]**

**PRESENTER**
We are drowning in "Gem Mint" cardboard. The supply is infinite, and the "Smart Money" will leave the building as soon as they can find enough suckers—I mean *investors*—to pay their inflated prices.

**[VISUAL: He holds up his hand and ticks off fingers. As he mentions the 10.2 billion cards, a graphic shows a cross-section of the Earth. Between "Mantle" and "Outer Core" is a thick layer labeled "POKEMON BULK."]**

**PRESENTER**
Second: The market is saturated. In 2020, the Pokemon Company printed 3.7 billion cards. By 2025, that number hit **10.2 billion.** Sixty percent of every Pokemon card ever made was printed *after* the pandemic began. It’s not a collection anymore; it’s a landfill.

**[VISUAL: A cartoon graphic of a dark cloud labeled "WACKY TARIFFS" floating over a tiny 2D drawing of a family having a picnic.]**

**PRESENTER**
Third: The broader economy is currently sucker-punching the Upper Middle Class—the very people who can actually afford these cards. Crypto has melted. High-tech jobs are being eaten by AI. Inflation is throttling wage increases. And we have "Wacky Tariffs" looming like a dark cloud over a picnic. 2027 will be a year of weeping. 2028 will be depressing.

**[VISUAL: The Presenter leans in so close that his nose touches the camera lens. It is slightly out of focus.]**

**PRESENTER**
There is a reason why the S&P 500 beats 99% of the market. If you think you’ve outsmarted the global financial elite because you have a box with a Charmander on it... well, good luck with that.

**[VISUAL: He suddenly snaps back to a sitting position, a terrifyingly wide and fake smile on his face.]**

**PRESENTER**
However! If you’ve made it this far into the video, there is something interesting happening in the year 2029. A market bounce! **$190!** **[VISUAL: He pulls a comically large, 1970s calculator with glowing red numbers from under the desk and starts pounding the buttons.]**

**PRESENTER**
If you buy then and sell in 2031 for our projected $272, that’s a **19.65% annual return.** It’s magnificent. It’s madness. It’s the only time you aren't being treated like a human piggy bank.

**[VISUAL: He sets the calculator down and straightens his tie.]**

**PRESENTER**
My suggestion is to park your money in the S&P 500 and forget about it. However, if you insist on buying Pokemon, don't buy based on emotion or YouTube videos. Run the numbers. Remember that Pokemon goes through cycles, and buying at the peak and selling at the bottom is a guaranteed way to blow up your retirement.

**[VISUAL: The music swells. The Presenter pulls a salt shaker from his pocket and begins to slowly and methodically salt a holographic Mew card.]**

**PRESENTER**
Goodnight. And may your top-loaders never yellow.

**[VISUAL: He lifts the salted card toward his mouth as the screen cuts to a black card with "THE END" in white letters.]**

**[FADE TO BLACK]**
