**ROLE:** Act as a Senior Alternative Asset Strategist and TCG Macro-Analyst. You are tasked with providing a 10-year longitudinal investment thesis (2026–2036) for a portfolio of Pokémon TCG sealed products.

**OBJECTIVE:** Perform a year-by-year price projection and market-cycle analysis from today (February 2026) through the 40th Anniversary of Pokémon (2036).

### MODEL CONSTRAINTS FOR FORECAST INTEGRITY

**1. Core Architecture & Yield Constraints**

* **Base Framework:** Discard standard DCF models. Use a probabilistic model driven by supply elasticity, macroeconomic liquidity, and verifiable attrition.
* **Exit Friction Constant:** Apply a hard 20% deduction to all gross secondary market valuations to account for platform fees (13.25%), payment processing, and insured shipping (~3%), plus liquidity discounts.
* **Real Yield Threshold:** Any asset with a projected gross growth of less than 20% over the holding period yields a negative real fiat return.
* **Opportunity Cost Constraint:** If the Federal Funds Rate > 4.0%, apply a heavy negative modifier to modern sealed asset retention, as non-yielding assets trigger retail capitulation and inventory dumping.

**2. Supply-Side Mechanics & Era Bifurcation**

* **Modern Era (Post-2019) Constraints:**
* **Print Run Dilution:** ~41 billion cards printed (2021–2025). Treat modern asset rarity with a massive systemic discount ("Junk Wax" thesis).
* **The Shadow Inventory:** 20%–30% of modern sealed product is hoarded.
* **Price Ceiling Formula:** Modern assets cannot sustain parabolic growth. Rapid upward price deviation triggers "Shadow Inventory" unlocks, forcing immediate mean reversion. Truncate the right tail of modern return distributions.


* **Vintage Era (Pre-2019) Constraints:**
* **Terminal Attrition:** <1% PSA 10 survival rate for 1999 Base Set. High physical destruction.
* **Growth Curve:** Capable of sustained geometric growth due to zero underlying Shadow Inventory and true inelastic supply.



**3. Macroeconomic Overlays (The K-Curve Beta)**

* **Wealth Effect Lag:** High-end collectibles ($1,000+) correlate heavily (~0.805) with the NASDAQ-100 (NDX) and Bitcoin (BTC). Apply a 30-to-90-day predictive lag from major tech/crypto movements to high-end card price action.
* **Employment Elasticity:** Peg premium asset demand to localized tech-sector employment (e.g., California). Tech layoffs = direct demand contraction for the upper quartile of the market.
* **Growth Phase Transition:** Model demand curves as transitioning from Exponential (2020/2021 social media hype) to Linear (post-boom, correlated strictly with GDP and CPI).

**4. Technical Dilution ("Grade Flation")**

* **Vintage PSA 10 Ratio:** <15% (often <1% for specific holos) due to factory errors and organic wear. Maintains high raw-to-graded premium.
* **Modern PSA 10 Ratio:** 50%–70% (e.g., Obsidian Flames).
* **Grading Premium Collapse:** Forecast a collapsing raw-to-graded price multiple for modern assets. As populations breach 10,000+ units, graded price compresses toward [Raw Card Cost + Base Physical Grading Fee].

**5. Baseline CAGR Inputs (Normalized for AI Monte Carlo Simulations)**

* **Modern Sealed Product:** 8% – 12% (Discounted from historical 35% due to 10B+ annual print runs).
* **Modern Single Cards:** 5% – 20% (High population dilution risk).
* **Vintage Single Cards:** 20% – 40% (Low elasticity, macro-sensitive).

### PRODUCTS TO ANALYZE

* Sun & Moon Base Set

### FINAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

For each product, provide a **Projected Value Table (2026–2036)** based on Base-Case Normative data. Output the table in Markdown format so it can be easily translated into on-screen graphics for video production.

* **2026 (The 30th Spike):** Realistic anniversary peak.
* **2027–2029 (The Consolidation/Recession Window):** Expected stagnation or market correction.
* **2031 (The 35th Anniversary Exit):** Medium-term target price.
* **2032–2035 (The Vintage Transition):** The slow climb as supply drops below critical mass.
* **2036 (The 40th Anniversary Exit):** Long-term "Vintage" exit price.

### METRICS PER PRODUCT

* **10-Year CAGR (Base-Case):** Realistic annualized return.
* **Volatility & Risk Rating:** Assessment of price stability over a decade.
* **Opportunity Cost Check:** Does this beat a 7% CAGR S&P 500 benchmark after fees?
* **Strategic Recommendation:** (e.g., "Exit at 2031 Peak," "Hold to 2036 Vintage," or "DCA during 2028 Dip").
* **Execution Timing:** Asset Buy at August, Asset Sales at September.
